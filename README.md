fn challenge is a project that helps you practice problem solving skills by writing functions. Sometimes you will be given hints. Other times you will have to learn a valuable skill: how to research. In other words, learn how to learn.

In order to make it in software development you will need to develop two skills:

1. Break down a problem into smaller problems
2. Learn how to learn.

Want more levels? Lets add them!

## How it works?

* Requirements Node v8 (https://nodejs.org)

- Clone Repo -

`git clone https://github.com/jrs-innovation-center/fn-challenge.git`

* Install dependencies and Start Server

**yarn:**

```sh
cd fn-challenge
yarn
yarn start
```

**npm:**

```sh
cd fn-challenge
npm install
npm start
```

> Windows Users install browser-sync globally
> `npm install browser-sync -g`

* Use your favorite editor to open the project

You will see 7 js files, called levelx.js and an index.js file.

Open level1.js and start working on the exercises, each time you complete an
exercise go to your browser and refresh the window to see the results.

When you finish the first level to go to the next level, simply uncomment the
level run code in the index.js file and then open the level js file and start
running that level.

## Linter Support

This project supports the `standard` js linter and `prettier`, installing both
projects in your editor will help find typos and bugs. In atom, install the
`linter` and `linter-eslint` packages.
